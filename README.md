* If you want to load your unpacked extension by yourself, then run `npm run dev`. This will create the extension inside an **dev** folder in `development` mode and will watch the `src` folder for changes.   
* [Load unpacked extensions](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked) with `./dev` folder. Though you have to reload the extension by yourself every time the `./dev` folder updates.
